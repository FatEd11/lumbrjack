    <p>Simplify the Law <strong>(STL)</strong> is a legal services startup now owned by the Simplify Group. STL is a platform that provides both automated legal documents and maintained legal guidance. Selling services direct to consumers under our own brand, and as a white label product for other providers. I am instrumental in the development and design of STL's digital products. I was also a small shareholder.</p>
    <p>I joined the company to help automate legal documents for use on STL's platform. I then moved into a position leading on both product management and design.</p>
    <p>I focus on talking to our users. I listen to the problems they are experiencing. Some are within our existing platform. Others are new problems which we have not yet tried to solve. We then, as a company, work out which problems solving makes financial sense.</p>
    <p>I devise the experiments to solve these problems, the metrics to measure their success, and design the solutions. This is why I love my job: lean product management makes sense to me.</p>

    <h2>Case study: site redesign</h2>
    <p>STL's original front end had a Web 1.0 feel to it. We had complaints from users, and so decided to start a redesign process. </p>
    <p>We began interviewing some of our white label users, to understand their specific problems. From our user interviews we concluded the following problems were most prominent:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Lack of clarity</strong>. Registration buttons, links and document creation buttons were not prominent enough. Leading to high drop out.</li>
      <li><b>Illegibility</b>. Given that the website is content focused, users found the typography difficult to read. And it was worse on mobile devices.</li>
      <li><strong>Lack of obvious support</strong>. Our users felt that we had no clear presence on our own site. Users lacked confidence in the guidance we offered, as we were not available to back it up.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      <div browser-image browser-img="/projects/stl/stl2.png" browser-alt="Strong negative space"></div>
    </div> 
  </div>
  <div class="portfolio-copy">
    <p>So we began an iterative process with them of:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>creating an initial design, based on our own <strong>hypotheses</strong></li>
      <li>letting our users <strong>critique</strong> this design, and</li>
      <li><strong>refining</strong> the design.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We <strong>repeated</strong> this process until we had something that solved the initial problems. </p>
    <p>We arrived at a design that made strong use of negative space. We employed a strong, contrasting palette to emphasise actions - including support options. We reworked our typography so it was legible at all display sizes. Additionally we made the layout responsive to changing screen size. </p>

      <li> Users spent longer on the site, and engaged with us more often. </li>
      <li>We saw increased clicks on the actions that lead to purchases.</li>
